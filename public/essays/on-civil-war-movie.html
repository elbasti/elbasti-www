<p>My title is On why I liked 'Civil War'</p>
<p>my content is:</p>
<p>Alex Garland’s <em>Civil War</em> is the best movie I’ve seen so far in 2024. Here’s why I liked it. As a bit of preamble, I write this review on the movie as an artifact—I know that the director has written about it, and explained some of his decisions—but I don’t much care about that. I’m going to review what was on screen.</p>
<p>Chock-full of spoilers ahead.</p>

<p>On <em>Civil War</em> and Campus Protests</p>
<p>As follow the characters on a road trip (very “heart of darkness”) getting deeper into the war zone of the civil war. What garland has done is ___ the fog of war: at first, the audience has no idea who is who. We see soldiers from one faction in hawaiian shirts. Others in full military uniform. Others are just townies with AR-15s.</p>
<p>The crux of the movie is a scene in which the reporters find themselves ambushed, along with two other soldiers, by an unknown sniper in a farmhouse.</p>
<p>Joel—the writer—rushes in to interview the two soldiers they find themselves stuck with. Joel, despite his drinking and juvenile horny demeanor, is the academic of the bunch. He’s the one that earlier in the movie was discussing “Portland Maoists” with another militia. He’s the one that’s trying to get to the president to get an interview and understand why he’s done what he’s done. </p>
<p>Joel believes in politics.</p>
<p>And so he rushes in to interview the two soldiers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joel: “Hey, whats going on?”
Soldier: “Someone in that house is stuck. We’re stuck.”
Joel: “Who do you think they are?”
Soldier: “I have no idea.”
Joel: “Are you WF? Who is giving you orders?”
Soldier: “Someone is trying to kill us. We are trying to kill them.”
Joel: “You don’t know what side they are fighting for?”
Soldier: “Oh, I get it. You’re retarded. You don’t understand a word I say.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The soldiers here understand, in a way Joel does not, that war is not about politics. War is about killing.</p>
<p>And the killing does not have to be organized.</p>
<p>Later in the trip, in what is by far the scariest part of the movie, they encounter Jesse Plemons, playing a psyschotic warlord in pink sunglasses. We’ve seen his character before. He’s Joseph Kony. He’s <a href="0">this guy</a>. </p>
<p>What does he believe? We don’t know. And the reporters don’t know either. They try 
Then you realize the protagonists dont know either. There’s a scene in which they try to figure out who a milita is by trying to identify who he has killed.</p>
