    <h1>On *Civil War* and Campus Protests</h1>
    <p>/some intro/</p>
<p>As follow the characters on a road trip (very “heart of darkness”) getting deeper into the war zone of the civil war. What garland has done is ___ the fog of war: at first, the audience has no idea who is who. We see soldiers from one faction in hawaiian shirts. Others in full military uniform. Others are just townies with AR-15s.</p>
<p>The crux of the movie is a scene in which the reporters find themselves ambushed, along with two other soldiers, by an unknown sniper in a farmhouse.</p>
<p>Joel—the writer—rushes in to interview the two soldiers they find themselves stuck with. Joel, despite his drinking and juvenile horny demeanor, is the academic of the bunch. He’s the one that earlier in the movie was discussing “Portland Maoists” with another militia. He’s the one that’s trying to get to the president to get an interview and understand why he’s done what he’s done. </p>
<p>Joel believes in politics.</p>
<p>And so he rushes in to interview the two soldiers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Joel: “Hey, whats going on?”
Soldier: “Someone in that house is stuck. We’re stuck.”
Joel: “Who do you think they are?”
Soldier: “I have no idea.”
Joel: “Are you WF? Who is giving you orders?”
Soldier: “Someone is trying to kill us. We are trying to kill them.”
Joel: “You don’t know what side they are fighting for?”
Soldier: “Oh, I get it. You’re retarded. You don’t understand a word I say.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The soldiers here understand, in a way Joel does not, that war is not about politics. War is about killing.</p>
<p>And the killing does not have to be organized.</p>
<p>Later in the trip, in what is by far the scariest part of the movie, they encounter Jesse Plemons, playing a psyschotic warlord in pink sunglasses. We’ve seen his character before. He’s Joseph Kony. He’s <a href="0">this guy</a>. </p>
<p>What does he believe? We don’t know. He has some private view of what it constitutes to be a “real american”. The reporters don’t know what he stands for either. They try to figure out his politics by asking if the bodies behind the warlord are wearing uniforms. They are not. The deeper the reporters go into the heart of darkness, the more each participant is playing by rules that exist entirely in their own minds.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with campus protests?</p>
<p>For posterity, at the moment there are encampents on unviersity campuses all over the world protesting Israel’s invasion of Gaza. </p>
