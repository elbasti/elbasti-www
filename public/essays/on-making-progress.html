<p>my content is:</p>
<p>“How does anything get done at all?” is a question I think about a lot. It’s an important question, I think. Surely, (one of?) the points of life is to <em>do</em> things, and surely the present state of humanity is some sort of sum of all the things that have been done. </p>
<p>It’s also a question I find paradoxical. Anyone that’s tried to do big, ambitious things knows how f’n hard it is: the most common outcome is failure. And yet we’re surrounded by stuff that just.got.done.</p>
